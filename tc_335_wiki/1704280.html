The server only comes with a basic schema to allow it to run. You have to use a database, such as TDB, populated with data, if you want to fully test the server.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-WheredidTDBcomefrom?"><span class="mw-headline">Where did TDB come from ?</span></h4><ul><li>UDB started as a merge of MoDB and SDB data. From UDB came TDB, a fork to provide data for TrinityCore.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Howoftendoyouupdateyourdatabase?"><span class="mw-headline">How often do you update your database ?</span></h4><ul><li>We release stable TDB releases combining all the changes between releases in irregular intervals and individual commits provide their required changes.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Whatis&quot;blizzlike&quot;?"><span class="mw-headline">What is &quot;blizzlike&quot; ?</span></h4><ul><li>TDB is attempting to replicate the Blizzard world for World of Warcraft. The term &quot;blizzlike&quot; means that it is close enough to being a replication of what is on the official Blizzard servers.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Whydoesn&#39;tmoreofTDBwork?"><span class="mw-headline">Why doesn't more of TDB work ?</span></h4><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Unless there is NO OTHER WAY and NEVER WILL BE, we refuse to put workarounds in the database. If the core doesn't support something yet, you can either use a different database, or live without that feature working. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">You could also attempt to contribute by testing and providing a proper solution or implement it properly.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">It is a big world, we try to fix as many bugs as we can when they are reported, but sometimes we miss some.</span></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Help:FAQ-Core-relatedFAQs"><span class="mw-headline">Core-related FAQs</span></h2><ul><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Whenistherepositorygoingstable?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: When is the repository going stable?</span></h4><ul><li>Soon...™</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Whatoperatingsystemsaresupported?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: What operating systems are supported?</span></h4><ul><li>Windows and *NIX (I.E. Linux)</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Ican&#39;truntheextractorsonWindows-platforms,itjustdisappearswhenIclickonit?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: I can't run the extractors on Windows-platforms, it just disappears when I click on it?</span></h4><ul><li>Please understand that it is a -commandline- tool, not a GUI-tool. This means you need to use the commandline in Windows (start a &quot;Command prompt&quot; and work there), not just nilly-willy doubleclick everywhere.</li><li>For information on how to &quot;maneuver&quot; around in a commandprompt, seek out Google (we're not here to teach you about how to use a commandprompt).</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Whydon&#39;tyouhaveAD.EXEandtheothertoolsintherepository?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: Why don't you have AD.EXE and the other tools in the repository ?</span></h4><ul><li>We decided to strip the precompiled binaries off from the repositories and let users compile it themselves from sourcecode instead.</li><li>&quot;AD.EXE&quot; is deprecated and is currently called &quot;MAPEXTRACTOR.EXE&quot; (on Windows - on *NIX-platforms it is just called &quot;mapextractor&quot;).</li><li>It will most probably change name again soon to reflect the real use of the tool itself.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Whycan&#39;tweuseolderversionsoftheMAP-andDBC-extractors?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: Why can't we use older versions of the MAP- and DBC-extractors ?</span></h4><ul><li>Do not use older versions of the tools, you'll get issues when starting up the core. See question after the next for further information.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:WhatareMaps,VMaps,MMapsandDBCsanyway?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: What are Maps, VMaps, MMaps and DBCs anyway ?<br /></span></h4><ul><li><strong>Note that TrinityCore does not support and does not condone any form of modification to client files or private / public servers! TrinityCore in itself is meant for theory-crafting and learning.</strong></li><li>Beside the core as binaries which give a fundamental and the individual client interpreting functions, definitions and commands, the core can be described as 'a body' with the following data forming it's 'anatomy':<br /><ul><li><strong>Maps</strong><strong>:</strong> Maps are <strong>a must and TrinityCore does not run without them</strong>. The maps provide physical values and data for the core to interpret. Based on these, the core has a layout that can be compared with each client. This includes area definition.</li><li><strong>DBCs:</strong> DBCs are <strong>a must and TrinityCore does not run without them</strong>. The DBCs (&quot;Data Base Client [Files]&quot;) give essential values that the World of Warcraft client interprets. They define races, textures, local models and more. TrinityCore interprets these and loads them up.</li><li><strong>VMaps:</strong> VMaps are <strong>optional, but highly recommended</strong>. VMaps (&quot;Virtual Maps&quot;) calculate the possibility of line-of-sight, as an example. Based on their content, the server can (for example) calculate if spell casts are possible (e.g. if a wall is in between the target and caster or not).</li><li><strong>MMaps:</strong> As of 02/2013, MMaps are <strong>experimental and thus optional</strong>. To further physical boundaries, MMaps (&quot;Movement Maps&quot;) enforce physical boundaries on non-player, e.g. npcs, as their collision is not handled by the client. They also improve path generation.</li></ul></li><li>Compiling TrinityCore with tools <strong>will always</strong> create the necessary tools to create these.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:IhaveissueswithextractingMaps,VMaps,MMaps,DBCs(andI&#39;vetriedusingolderversionsoftheextractors)-whatiswrong?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: I have issues with extracting Maps, VMaps, MMaps, DBCs (and I've tried using older versions of the extractors) - what is wrong?</span></h4><ul><li>The old tools have been deprecated as we now use newer and more optimized methods for extracting/compiling the data required to generate the files that the server uses.</li><li>We decided to do this to avoid issues with users having multiple setups, and to avoid having two sets of maps/vmaps/whatever when attempting to compare code/functionality between TrinityCore</li><li>and other projects - at the moment the tools are called MAPEXTRACTOR, MESHEXTRACTOR, MMAPS_GENERATOR, VMAP4EXTRACTOR and VMAP4ASSEMBLER (this will most probably change again though to reflect the real use of the tools themselves).</li><li>Another note is that the tools requires a commandprompt (as mentioned earlier in this FAQ)</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:I&#39;mmissingthelibrariesforMySQL(mysql.lib)andcan&#39;tseemtofindthemintherepository?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: I'm missing the libraries for MySQL (mysql.lib) and can't seem to find them in the repository?</span></h4><ul><li>The libraries has been removed from the sourcetree simply to avoid bloat - make sure to install the MySQL-server WITH DEVELOPMENT HEADERS (make SURE to tick that little square when installing).</li><li>(If you use the ESSENTIALS-package, you will NOT get the development-headers/libraries - use the full package and make SURE you install the &quot;development&quot;-stuff).</li><li>You can also SEARCH THE FORUMS for further information.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:I&#39;mmissingthelibrariesforOpenSSL(ssleya32.lib/libeay32.lib)andcan&#39;tseemtofindthemintherepository?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: I'm missing the libraries for OpenSSL (ssleya32.lib / libeay32.lib) and can't seem to find them in the repository?</span></h4><ul><li>These libraries are from the OpenSSL project, and the precompiled versions has been removed from the sourcetree simply to avoid bloat.</li><li>Further information about this will be given when we have found a common way to do it on all platforms.</li><li>You can also search the TrinityCore forums for further information/help.</li></ul></li><li><h4 id="Help:FAQ-Q:Whycan&#39;tIcompileon32-bitand64-bitsystems?"><span class="mw-headline">Q: Why can't I compile on 32-bit and 64-bit systems?</span></h4><ul><li>The core and extractors has been tested on 32-bit and 64-bit systems, and should work - use the bugtracker for issues with that, if any</li></ul></li></ul>
