ALWAYS READ THE TOPIC</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">It's the first thing you see when you connect to or join the channel and it is usually at the top of the screen at all times. Read it when you connect, when you join, when you come back from being away. Always.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>2. We are volunteers!</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">The people helping out in #Trinity and on </span><a href="http://www.trinitycore.org" style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">www.trinitycore.org</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> or .info are doing so voluntarily and not being compensated in any way. We do not owe you anything, nor are we obligated to respond to you. Please show common courtesy and show your appreciation for everyone giving you their time.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>3. This is not designed as a support channel!</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Remember, #Trinity is not designed to be a support channel - people just help out when they can.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">That being said, you're likely to get help faster if you follow our </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.trinitycore.org/f/topic/69-help-us-help-you/" rel="nofollow" style="">Help us Help you</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> AND </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.trinitycore.org/f/topic/4046-tired-of-asking-always-the-same-questions/" rel="nofollow" style="">Ask wisely</a></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>4. Ignorance isn't a valid defense.</strong></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>5. No excessive usage of profanity</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">While we have no objection to sharing your opinions and debating a topic - in fact, we encourage it - with other members of this community, we do not tolerate any excessive profanity whatsoever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">A minor or infrequent usage of profanity is permitted. If you are found to be using profanity frequently, your posts will be deemed of a flaming nature and you will be dealt with accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Since the measure of excessive usage is ultimately decided by channel staff on a case by case basis, you will receive ample warning prior to being banned due to the infringement of this clause.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>6. No racism, discrimination, threats, harassment or personal attacks of any kind are permitted.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">This is a friendly community and as such you are expected to be courteous and follow general chatting etiquette. There are times when you may not agree with someone, or you've had a bad day and that's fine, we all have those days. But please, for your own benefit, leave your problems off Trinitycore.org and our of the channel. Doing so will ensure that the TrinityCore Community is a welcoming, friendly one and not machiavelli drunk on any day that ends in the word day.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>7. No vulgarity or obscenity.</strong></p><p><strong><span> </span>8. No spamming is permitted, whatsoever.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Spam is posting any content that is not within the topic of discussion, or does not contribute anything to the channel - off topic OR on topic. The definition of spam used by this community is determined by the channel staff and is not open to discussion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Spam also constitutes, but is not limited to, messages that are formatted incorrectly (has excessive colour, bold etc.) or is in all caps, mixed caps or any other formatting deemed intrusive or annoying by the channel staff.</span></p><p> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong><span> </span>9. No flaming, inciting hatred or instigating flame bait is permitted.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">This is a friendly community and as such you are expected to be courteous and follow general chatting etiquette.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">In general, any parties involved in a flame-fest - whether they be the instigator or the flamer, will be dealt with accordingly. The best way to stay out of trouble, with regards to flame-fests, is to not join in.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>10. No selling of products or services, unless approved by a member of the channel staff.</strong></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>11. Do not ask for a position on staff.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">For those of you interested in being a part of the TrinityCore Community staff, here's some advice: Since launching we've received requests from people to be a part of our staff - be it IRC, wiki, community, etc. but what is important to note is that the vast majority of those requests have been accompanied by a lack of initiative being shown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Show some initiative and your work will be noticed, along with your attitude and your passion for the community and the chances of us picking you up to help out will be higher. This should really have gone without saying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">If you ask for a position or privileges, you reduce the chances of your getting it. You shouldn't have to ask; you demonstrate that you fit the bill and things should fall into line.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>12. No advertising.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Advertising of any form is completely prohibited unless otherwise stated by channel staff.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>13. Disrespect and intolerance towards other people is NOT acceptable.</strong></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>14. BE PATIENT and no excessive repeating</strong></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>15. Pastebin logs, code snippets, crashdumps, anything longer than 3 lines!</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Please use </span><a class="external-link" href="http://pastie.org/" rel="nofollow" style="">http://pastie.org</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">, </span><a class="external-link" href="http://pastebin.com/" rel="nofollow" style="">http://pastebin.com</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">, </span><a class="external-link" href="http://slexy.org/" rel="nofollow" style="">http://slexy.org</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> or</span><a class="external-link" href="http://gist.github.com/" rel="nofollow" style="">http://gist.github.com</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> instead.</span></p><p><br /><strong><span> </span>16. This is an English only channel</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Please try and speak English only in our channel as our staff do not understand any other languages, making it difficult to moderate the channel effectively. Please also refrain from bastardising the English language through the use of &quot;txt speak&quot; as it is very annoying and has no place on IRC.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h1 style="text-align: center;" id="IRC-Note:">Note:</h1><p style="text-align: center;">While we try to guarantee that every member is given three chances, we reserve the right to make any decision we believe is necessary to address the situation at hand up to and including, but not limited to, banning someone without warning.</p><p style="text-align: center;">The above stated are not absolute.
